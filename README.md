# What's this all about?

A couple of suggestions brought up this project where the KapeVSC community can practice and contribute using their web development skills by developing a simple application.

# This Project

A simple calendar application that allows our discord community members to use it to record meaningful events, notes, and other things that they need to record of data on a particular date and time.

# Requirements

As a user, I want to be able to record my data in a chronological order using calendar grid system so that I could easily recall and share to others what happened on a particular date and time.

## Acceptance Criteria

- users should be able to enter a title and a description box that accepts markdown syntax together with their server discord nickname
- users should be able to filter out only their own calendar entries by remembering their discord nickname when they load the page; this will also display all shared entries by other users
- first time access of the page should prompt the user of their discord server nickname
- user should be able to search their entries by the title and the text from the description box
- user should be able to share their entries to a set of other users based off their discord server nicknames
